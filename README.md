# Run Tests <a name="Run"></a>

Cypress has two main modes: an interactive mode which has a point-and-click GUI, helpful visualizations of test runs, the ability to walk forward and backward through a previously run test, and other handy things. The other mode is a CLI mode very much like a unit testing framework like Mocha.

Test videos are generated in the "videos" folder when running tests via the CLI, which you can browse later.

**Run tests in interactive mode**

1. Open your terminal and run `npx cypress open`; this will open the Cypress interactive test runner.

2. Select the feature file you wish to run. For this assignment, it is: home.cy.js

**Run tests in CLI mode**

1. Open terminal.

2. For this assignment, there is prepared npm scipts in the package.json for common use case. To run this, use "npm run test"

   "test": run matomo tests

# Run Tests <a name="Run"></a>

2. View the report under cypress/reports/html folder.
